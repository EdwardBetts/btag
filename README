Introduction
============

btag is a command line based multimedia tagger. It retains information about
the filesystem structure so that users can tag a bunch of albums with ease. In
some ways, btag can be compared to graphical taggers like EasyTAG[1] as both
allow you to tag a lot of songs in batches.

The following features are implemented:

* Tagging of a vast number of formats supported by TagLib[2]
* Tag normalization and filtering
* Locale-aware title capitalization
* Renaming of files and directories

Configuration
=============

All configuration is done through command line switches. Refer to btag(1) for
more information on the supported switches.


Future goals
============

btag is already usable as of now. It wouldn't hurt to bring more features from
EasyTAG or to provide more control over specific tags.
