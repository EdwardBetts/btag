Introduction
============

btag is a command line based multimedia tagger. It retains information about
the filesystem structure so that users can tag a bunch of albums with ease. In
some ways, btag can be compared to graphical taggers like EasyTAG[1] as both
allow you to tag a lot of songs in batches.

The following features are implemented:

* Tagging of a vast number of formats supported by TagLib[2]
* Tag normalization and filtering
* Locale-aware title capitalization
* Renaming of files and directories

Configuration
=============

All configuration is done through command line switches. Refer to btag(1) for
more information on the supported switches.


Future goals
============

btag is already usable as of now. It wouldn't hurt to bring more features from
EasyTAG or to provide more control over specific tags.

Some specific goals (nothing set in stone, though):

* A test suite for the capitalization and renaming algorithms (1.1.2)
* Load the configuration from a configuration file (1.2.0)
* Deprecate some command line switches (1.2.0, removal in 1.3.0)
* Handle some other tags better (such as the comment tag, 1.2.0)
* Music Brainz integration (1.3.0)
* Read the information in CUE files (1.3.0)


Contributing
============

Any help is appreciated, please feel free to contribute. I'll review your
patches and commit them if they are in accordance with this project's goals,
and you'll be credited for the changes (I may ask you to change a few things
things before your patches are accepted, though).

For the time being, send your patches to:

Fernando Tarlá Cardoso Lemos <fernandotcl AT gmail.com>

Please format your patches with "git format-patch" and then attach them to an
e-mail instead of sending the patches inlined in the message. This makes it
easier for me to apply them.
