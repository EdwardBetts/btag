Introduction
============

qtagger is a command line based multimedia tagger. It retains information
about the filesystem structure so that users can tag a bunch of albums with
ease. In some ways, qtagger can be compared to graphical taggers like
EasyTAG[1] as both allow you to tag a lot of songs in batches.

The following features are implemented:

* Tagging of a vast number of formats supported by TagLib[2]
* Tag normalization and filtering
* Locale-aware title capitalization
* Renaming of files and directories

Configuration
=============

All configuration is done through command line switches. Refer to qtagger(1)
for more information on the supported switches.


Future goals
============

qtagger is already usable as of now. Some features we'd like to see
implemented in the future are:

* Support for renaming filters to work around filesystem limitations
